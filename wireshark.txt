===== DAYTIME =====
1) The three parts of the TCP handshake would be: 

Number  Source        Destination   Info
1       192.168.64.2  129.6.15.29   [SYN] Seq=0 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460 
                                        SACK_PERM TSval=33221936906 TSecr=0 
                                        WS=128
2       129.6.15.29   192.168.64.2  [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=65535 Len=0 
                                        MSS=1382 WS=64 SACK_PERM
3       192.168.64.2  129.6.15.29   [ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=64256 Len=0


2) The client port is 40340, it is labeled as the source port for the packets 
that leave from Kali (192.168.64.2).


3) The client needs a port because there could be different application 
processes running on the client machine, so when the computer gets the TCP 
responses, it needs to know what process (and its port) that it must send it 
to. 


4) The frame with the actual date and time looks like:
Number  Source        Destination    Info
4       129.6.15.29   192.168.64.2   105 DAYTIME RESPONSE


5) [SYN] refers to synchronization and is used by the client and server to 
start communication and make sure they know each other. [ACK] means 
acknowledgement, that the destination got what was sent it. 


6) The Kali client initiated closing the TCP connection by sending [FIN, ACK].
The daytime server also sent [FIN] to mean that it had finished sending all 
of the requested information.


===== HTTP ===== 
1) Four TCP connections were opened. I can tell by using the capture filter 
tcp.flags.syn == 1 and checking the packets that were sent by Kali. Kali sent 
four [Syn] packets each with a different source port. They must be different
connections because they have different ports. 


2) Yes. I believe that this is requesting index.html because it is marked as an 
HTML GET request and has the name of the file. 

Number  Source        Destination       Protocol  Length Info
8       192.168.64.2  172.233.221.124   HTTP      424    GET /index.html HTTP/1.1



3) Yes. Same reasoning as for question 2). 

Number   Source        Destination       Protocol  Length Info
21       192.168.64.2  172.233.221.124   HTTP      463    GET /jeff-square-colorado.jpg HTTP/1.1
